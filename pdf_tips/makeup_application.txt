Face Makeup
1.1 Preparing the skin
Creating an excellent base for your makeup is just as important as the makeup itself! As the
makeup artist, you are responsible for making your client’s skin the perfect palette for your
work. By taking appropriate steps to prepare the skin, the makeup will go on smoother and
last longer. Depending on the bride, event or situation you may have the opportunity to
really work with your client in skin preparation. Additionally, you can always provide
detailed instructions to a client prior to your makeup application.
1.1.1 Cleansing
The first step in preparing the skin is cleansing. Cleansing is critical to ensure that any
previous makeup is removed, along with any dirt, oil or residue. There are a few options
when it comes to cleansing your client’s skin that you could choose:
Makeup Removing Wipes One of the easiest ways to cleanse the skin is by utilizing a
makeup removing wipe. This option is great for times where you need a quick option to
remove makeup, or you are limited on space. To start, take a makeup removing wipe and
gently wipe it across the face in slow, smooth movements applying a small amount of
pressure. Continue this motion with clean areas of the wipe until all makeup and dirt is
removed.
Cleansing Cloth Another option for cleansing the skin is by utilizing a cleansing cloth.
Typically, a microfiber towel, these cloths combine with water to effectively cleanse the skin
and remove makeup. Taking a clean cloth, wet with water and smooth all over the face to
cleanse.
Cleansing Facial Soap, The most effective way to cleanse the skin is by using a traditional
cleansing facial soap on the skin to remove makeup, dirt and oil. If you are doing this on a
client, gently wet the skin with a damp washcloth. Follow up by applying the facial soap with
either your fingers or a cloth until any residue has lifted. Finish by using a damp washcloth
to remove the soap and pat dry. If you are doing this on yourself, simply wet the face and
use the facial soap to wash your face in the traditional fashion to cleanse.
1.1.2 Exfoliating & Toning
After cleansing, it is important to either exfoliate or tone the skin. This allows the skin to return to its
optimal state, and can help prep the skin’s texture for makeup application. When it comes to exfoliating,
this would typically be done by using a chemical or physical exfoliant on the skin. A chemical exfoliant
removes dead skin cells with its chemical enzymes, and a physical exfoliant typically has small beads or
grains. Exfoliating helps your skin remove dead skin cells, and can even out your skin’s texture prior to
applying makeup.
Similarly, toning your skin helps ensure there are no traces of makeup, dirt or oil on the skin. Wipe a
toner across your client’s skin using a cotton pad, or spritz onto skin prior to moisturizing.

1.1.3 Hydrating
Hydrating the skin after a thorough cleansing routine is critical to keeping the skin from drying out during
the makeup application process. Take a moisturizer, and pat gently into the skin to allow the moisturizer
to fully sink into the skin. The gentle pressing will also promote circulation in the skin, which will give the
skin a healthy glow prior to makeup application.
After applying a moisturizer, if the skin still needs a bit of hydration there are some more options.
Spraying the face with a hydrating mist such as an Evian spray or rose water will help seal in the
moisturizer and make the skin plump and dewy.
1.2 Sunless Tanning
If your bride or client is looking to have a bronze glow on their big day, there are a few options to give
them a natural tan without the sun. Avoiding the sun prior to a big event is extremely important, as the
sun can dry out the skin and promote unwanted wrinkles and sun spots. Instead of laying out in the sun
or hitting a tanning bed, use a sunless tanning option to achieve the bronze glow.
1.2.1 Sunless Tanning - What are the options?
There are a few different options when it comes to sunless tanning. Here, we will break down the
different sunless tanning options to help you choose which is best for yourself or your client.
7 | P age
 Personalized Spray Tan: This is the highest end option, and requires hiring a spray tan
technician to do a one-on-one spray tan for your bride. These technicians may be located in
a salon, or may even come directly to the event site. For these sessions, the technician will
hand spray you to achieve the perfect colour and application for an individual client.
 Spray Tan Booth: Many salons offer spray tanning booths that make getting a professional
spray tan extremely easy and quick. In these booths, you can customize the colour to
achieve your desired level of bronze. There are many different types of spray tan booths, so
be sure to do some research to ensure you will choose the right one for you or your clients.
Additionally, you can utilize the salon staff to gain knowledge prior to using a spray tan
booth.
 Self-Tanning Mousse: For a natural a buildable option with even application, opt for a self-
tanning mousse to add a bronze glow to your skin. These self-tanning mousses typically look
like a foam or whipped texture, and are typically applied with a mit for even texture. Self-
tanning mousses often are a bit more foolproof, but can be a bit difficult to apply in hard to
reach areas (like the shoulders and back). For perfect application, take your time or even
recruit a friend to help with application for your big day.
 Self-Tanning Spray: When it comes to easy application, a self-tanning spray allows you to
easily tan your entire body. It is important to do plenty of product research before using
aself-tanning spray, in order to find one with a steady stream and even application. Make
sure to apply carefully, so as not to go over the same area multiple times creating an uneven
tan.
8 | P age
 Self-Tanning Lotion: The most common product on the market is self-tanning lotions, so you
have plenty of options if you choose to go this route. The lotions often have different
qualities, such as colour, application and development time. Some may have a bit of
shimmer, while others are matte. As with all of these products, do your research prior to
purchasing in order to determine which self-tanning lotion will best meet your needs.
1.2.2 Application Best Practices
In order to make your sunless tan last as long as possible and achieve a flawless application, there are a
few critical steps prior to application.
1. Shave or wax: When it comes to removing unwanted hair, it’s important to do this prior to
applying sunless tanner. These actions can actually remove sunless tanner, so shave or wax
well before your sunless tan application.
2. Exfoliate: Before applying self-tanner, it is absolutely essential to remove dead skin and
flakes. To avoid dark patches of tanner clinging to these areas, use an exfoliating body scrub
9 | P age
in the shower to slough away dead skin cells. Be sure to focus on common rough patches,
like the elbows, knees, ankles and heels.
3. Moisturize: After exfoliating, it’s important to add some moisture back into your skin prior
to applying sunless tanner. Using a lightweight moisturizer, apply evenly all over your body
in a thin layer. Dab a bit of extra lotion in areas where the self-tanner may cling, like around
the cuticles and behind the knees.
3.
4. Start from the bottom up: In order to achieve the most flawless self-tan application, start
your application at the bottom of your body and work your way up. Begin applying at the
feet and ankles, and then move up in circular motions along the legs and thighs. This will
help ensure there are no strange marks or creases as you bend to apply the sunless tanner.
5. Be patient: Allow yourself time to apply the tanner slowly and carefully, and don’t rush your
application process. Once you have applied your sunless tanner, be patient and allow the
tanner to dry completely before putting on clothing. You will want to avoid showering for 6-
8 hours, to allow the tanner plenty of time to develop.
6. Clean it up: If you have any dark patches or poor application, clean up those areas by
rubbing half a lemon on the area and follow up with a damp towel. The acidity of the lemon
10 | P age
will help remove any self-tanner that you’re hoping to remove to even out the look of your
glow.
7. Preserve your glow: You can help your sunless tanner last as long as possible by using gentle
products (like gentle cleansers and soaps), and by keeping your skin constantly moisturized.
1.3 Face Makeup
Now that the skin is prepped and ready to go, it’s time to find the perfect makeup to achieve a flawless
complexion. Between foundations, concealers and powders there are countless options - how do you
know which is the right one? We will break down the different types of products and perfect application,
so that your bride will have perfect skin on her big day.
1.3.1 Foundation Finishes
A foundation finish is best described as the look of your skin after the foundation is set. It will be
important to consult with your client to determine the desired look they want for their skin on the day of
the wedding or event. A close comparison would be the paint on your walls - the finish of the paint varies
so it’s important to know the difference in order to make the best choice for you and your client.
 Dewy Finish: A foundation with a dewy finish will often be described as luminous, fresh and
youthful. Many times, dewy finish foundations will create the look of hydrated skin, and are
great for people with dry or aging skin. Skin looks radiant, and can often have a bit of
opalescence to the foundation. This finish is not the best for oily skin, as it can often
accentuate the shiny nature of oily skin.
 Satin Finish: A satin finish foundation falls in the middle of the three finishes, and is not
quite dewy but not quite matte. This is a natural looking finish, and has a soft sheen on the
skin. This is the most universal finish, and looks good on almost every skin type!
 Matte Finish: If your client is looking for a flat and “perfect” finish, a matte finish foundation
is the choice for them. For those with oily skin, this finish will give them optimal wear time
and finish. Similarly, for skin that has different textures a matte finish foundation will create
a flat finish to help even the skin’s tone and texture.
11 | P age
1.3.2 Foundation Coverage
The coverage level of a foundation is essentially the amount of pigment in a foundation, and how much
the foundation will cover in one layer. To determine the appropriate coverage level for you or your client,
it is important to understand how much skin they would like to show through the makeup. The coverage
of a foundation can often vary based on how it is applied, but in general you can learn how a foundation
may look on the skin by understanding its coverage level.
 Sheer Coverage: A sheer coverage foundation will provide very light coverage to the skin, so
you will be able to see much of the skin through the foundation. This coverage level will
naturally enhance the look of your skin, and will slightly blur any imperfections.
 Medium Coverage: For natural coverage of any blemishes, dark spots or imperfections,
medium coverage foundation is the perfect choice. This option covers most skin issues on its
own, while still giving the skin a natural look. Any larger blemishes or discolouration may
require additional product to conceal, but overall this is an excellent option for those with
minimal skin issues.
 Medium to Full Coverage: This foundation will act similarly to a medium coverage
foundation, with the option to build coverage up to a full coverage look. Depending on how
it is applied, medium to full coverage foundations can still provide a natural look while still
offering customizable coverage. This is an excellent option for those who may have
combination skin needing a bit more coverage in some areas than others.
12 | P age
Full Coverage: This foundation contains the most pigment, and will cover skin completely. For those truly
focused on having flawless skin for an event or photography, this coverage will achieve full coverage for
heavy discolouration or other skin issues. This coverage will look the least natural against the skin, so
application is critical to achieve a blended look.
1.3.3 Concealer
When it comes to concealing dark spots and imperfections, the best way to understand what shade to
choose comes back to the basics of the colour wheel. Shades directly across from each other on the
colour wheel will cancel each other out, which is the goal when colour correcting with concealer. Here,
we will dive into further detail on the different colour correcting concealer options and when to use each
one.
 Yellow Concealers: With yellow being right across from purple on the colour wheel, yellow
concealers are excellent at correcting purple tones in the skin. For bruises or purple veins,
yellow concealers will counteract the purple tones to allow for even colouring across the
skin. A high coverage yellow concealer can also be a great option for covering up any tattoos
for an event or photos.
 Peach/Salmon Concealer: Since this tone is a combination of red and orange tones, it is
extremely helpful in concealing blue and purple tones in the skin. More specifically, these
shades are ideal for colour correcting dark circles under the eyes. Salmon and peach toned
concealers offer immense brightening under the eye, which is perfect for making the face
look awake and luminous.
13 | P age
 Green Concealer: Since green is directly across from red on the colour wheel, this is an
excellent option for covering any unwanted redness on the skin. Specifically, this is an ideal
concealer colour to use for acne, blemishes or red toned hyperpigmentation. If your client
struggles with redness all over the face from rosacea or sunburn, a green tinted primer will
help counteract these issues for a flawless foundation colouring.
 Purple Concealer: For those who suffer from yellow or sallow skin tone, a purple concealer
is the perfect option to colour correct those issues. For yellow spots on the skin, a purple
spot concealer will counteract the yellow tones on the face or body.
 Tan/Neutral Concealer: For those with minimal skin issues, a neutral skin-toned concealer
will suffice for covering any minor imperfections. When it comes to the occasional blemish
or minor dark circles under the eyes, a neutral concealer will be a perfect option to cover a
multitude of issues. This is a great option to have on hand for any small skin issue that may
pop up on an irregular basis.
1.3.4 Powder
After choosing the perfect foundation and concealer, it is important to set those products with a setting
powder to ensure your makeup application lasts all day long without any shine. There are a few different
options when it comes to setting powder, so it is important to understand the differences in order to
choose the best one for yourself or your client. Here are the main choices you will need to make when
choosing a setting powder.
 Pressed vs. Loose: There are two main choices when it comes to the texture of the setting
powder you choose. A common option for daily use is the mess-free pressed powder, which
often comes in a compact. These powders will commonly be used for quick fixes, as well as
14 | P age
daily use. When it comes to lose powder, this is often a makeup artist’s first choice for
weddings and events. Loose powders are often finer milled, which translates beautifully in
photography and videography. They can also create a more natural, less “powdery” look on
the face when setting foundation and concealer.
 Pigmented vs. Translucent: In addition to the actual powder itself, you also will have the
choice of whether to utilize a pigmented powder or a translucent powder. A powder with
pigment will add additional coverage to any foundation or concealer you have already
applied. This is a great option for those looking for extra coverage on top of a sheer or
medium coverage foundation. Alternatively, translucent powders offer no additional
coverage and will simply assist with setting the foundation and concealer. Translucent
powders work well for setting high coverage foundations, as well as those looking to set
their completed foundation application.

1.4 Face Makeup Application
Now that you’ve learned how to choose the best makeup products for yourself or your client, it is
essential to know the best application techniques to achieve optimal results. There are a few key tools
that are common for makeup artist foundation applications, so here we will breakdown the differences
between the many different facial brushes and sponges for ideal application.
1.4.1 Choosing Your Materials
There are so many different brands and types of brushes, but one of the easiest places to start is by
choosing which material your brush is made from. There are both natural and synthetic fibers, which can
make a difference in how the brushes apply makeup. Different types of brushes work best with different
products, so it’s important to know the differences between the types of brushes and materials.
 Natural Brushes: Natural brushes are made out of natural fibers, which typically mean they
are made from real hair. Most often they are from various types of animal hair, so it may be
best to look for cruelty-free brushes if that appeals to you or your client base. There are
some benefits about natural brushes, and since they are made from natural fibers they often
behave like hair. They typically have more texture compared to synthetic brushes, and can
behave more durably in your makeup collection. Natural brushes are best used for powder
products, as they often blend easier than their synthetic counterparts.
 Synthetic Brushes: As you might guess from the name, synthetic brushes are made from
synthetic, manmade materials. Because they are not made up of natural hair, they do not
have the ability to absorb any product through the porous texture or cuticle. This makes
them great options for liquid or cream products, like concealer, foundation and even
skincare products. Synthetic brushes can vary in quality, so be sure to feel the bristles if
possible to determine if they will work for your purpose.
1.4.2 Choosing Your Shape
When it comes to applying foundation, concealer and powder, application can make all the difference.
There are a variety of shapes and styles of brushes, and it is important to use the right one for your
product. Here are a few of the most common brushes for applying foundation, concealer and powder.
 Foundation Brush: This is most often a densely packed brush, with tapered bristles to apply
foundation in a precise manner. When it comes to building up coverage, a foundation brush
will allow you to achieve your ideal coverage and an airbrushed finish. This brush is best
used for cream or liquid foundation.
 Stippling Brush: Not as dense, this brush is often made of duo fiber bristles and allows a
strong coverage. When the product is stippled on, it achieves a poreless finish with a
blended look. This is an extremely versatile brush, and can be used to apply cream, liquid or
powder products.
16 | P age
 Concealer Brush: Almost a smaller version of the foundation brush, the concealer brush is a
tapered brush for precise application. This can assist with using product in specific places,
like the corners of the eyes or on blemishes. The concealer brush is best used with liquid and
cream concealers.
 Powder Brush: Powder brushes can come in varying shape, but most often have a fluffy,
rounded shape. With its loosely packed bristles and soft texture, powder brushes are best
used for applying product all over a large area. Most often, powder brushes are best used
for applying loose or pressed powder products.
 Kabuki Brush: With a short handle and densely packed bristles, kabuki brushes often have a
rounded shape. When used to apply product, they will provide medium coverage and more
precision than a powder brush. Kabuki brushes are best used for applying both loose and
pressed powder products to achieve more precision or coverage.

Eye Makeup
Eyes are arguably one of the most important features on the face, and it is especially important to
accentuate them for a wedding or special event. Since the shape, colour and size of eyes can vary
significantly, it is essential to understand how to best apply makeup for each client’s eyes. There are
many different factors when applying makeup to the eyes, and it is definitely not a one size fits all
process. In this module, you will learn how to determine a client’s eye shape, choosing the perfect colour
palette and products, best application techniques and even how to apply false lashes.
19 | P age
2.1 Determining the Eye Shape
There are a number of different eye shapes, and each shapes requires a different application of eye
makeup. It is critical to take a moment to determine the eye shape of your client, and change your
application to meet their needs. By developing a strong understanding of the different eye shapes, you
will be able to quickly assess the eye shape of any client.
20 | P age
Monolid Eyes: Do you see a crease when looking at your client’s eyes? If you answered no, then your
client has monolid eyes. Monolid eyes may appear flat on the surface, with little to no crease.
Additionally, the brow bone will appear less defined or even flush with the lid.
Upturned Eyes: If your client has a crease, then there are a few additional steps needed to determine the
eye shape. If the corners of your client’s eyes turn up slightly, then they have upturned eyes. Upturned
eyes have a visible eyelid, and have a natural lift at the outer corner. The bottom lash line may appear
longer than the top lash line, which is caused by the natural upward turn.
Downturned Eyes: If you determine your client’s outer corner turns down slightly, then they have
downturned eyes. Downturned eyes, as their name sounds, have a slight dropping on the outer corners
while still maintaining a visible lid.
Round Eyes: For eyes that go generally straight across, you will next want to look at the irises of the eye.
If there is any white visible around the irises that is a sign that your client likely has round eyes. Round
eyes often seem larger, and have a larger vertical width compared to many other eye shapes.
Almond Eyes: Like their namesake, almond eyes follow the general shape of the healthy nut. Similar to
round eyes, almond eyes go generally straight across but have less visible white space than round eyes.
The irises often disappear behind the upper and lash line, and there is more length to the eye than
height. Almond eyes are considered the most common eye shape.
Hooded Eyes: If your client has a crease but it seems to be hidden, they likely have hooded eyes. Hooded
eyes have an extra bit of skin that comes down and covers up the crease, making it appear hidden. The
eyelid may seem smaller or disappear altogether, and the brow bone may seem more prominent than
the lid or crease.
2.2 Eye Shape Makeup Application
Now that you understand how to determine your client’s eye shape, you need to know how to best apply
makeup for each eye shape! This knowledge will ensure that you can achieve your client’s desired eye
look, and avoid taking a one size fits all approach. It is essential to cater your eye makeup looks to your
individual client, and we will walk through some of the best tips and tricks for accentuating your client’s
eyes.
Monolid Eyes: Many people will overcompensate for their monolids by applying extremely thick eyeliner,
but that can look harsh if done incorrectly. Instead, use a darker eyeshadow to draw out a cat eye and
winged liner effect. The darker colour will make your eyes appear larger and rounder. Keep your darker
shade focused on the outer corner, and bring a lighter highlight shade in the inner corner to brighten
your eyes. Finish off with a thin line of liquid eyeliner, and a volumizing mascara to complete the look.
Upturned Eyes: Upturned eyes are the perfect shape to follow a classic smokey eye technique. Start by
putting a lighter shade on the inner half of your lid. Follow up with a medium shade on the outer half of
your lid, and line your top lashline with a line that gets slightly thicker as you reach the outer corner. For
a more intense look, add a bit of depth into the outer corner with a deeper shade of eyeshadow. You’ll
enhance your eye’s natural upward lift.
21 | P age
Downturned Eyes: Eyeliner will be a key component in giving downturned eyes a little lift. Start by
sweeping the lid with a lighter shade, and then blending a medium shade into the natural crease. Take a
liquid eyeliner, and line the upper lash line with a strong winged shape or cat eye. Bring your liner out
past the corner and finish it with an upward curve to complete the cat eye.
Round Eyes: Round eyes are typically slightly larger, so you will want to highlight the inner corner and
brow bone. Take a darker shade, and buff into the crease and outer corner to elongate your eyes. Line
the entire upper lash line, and finish with a small cat eye to further lengthen the eye shape.
Almond Eyes: Because almond eyes are the most symmetrical, almost any eye makeup will look beautiful
on this eye shape! Start by sweeping a lighter shade all over the lid, and buff a medium shadow into the
crease. Play around with deepening up the crease, and even add some intensity with a bit of shimmer.
Lengthening mascara will enhance any eye look, and help accentuate the shadow.
Hooded Eyes: When it comes to applying makeup to hooded eyes, it is essential to follow great blending
techniques to prevent transfer from the lash line to the upper lid. Sweep a medium shade across the
entire lid, and blend upwards above the crease. Use a darker shade around the crease to help further
define and contour the eye shape. To further define the top eyelid, tight-line the upper lash line and
really thicken the lashes with a dark mascara.

2.3 Eye shadow
You’ve heard a bit more detail about ideal application techniques for eyeshadow, but now it’s time to
learn more details about the different eyeshadow finishes, colour tones and palettes. When choosing
which eyeshadow products to use, it is important to understand how each product will look on the eye.
We will discuss a number of different attributes an eyeshadow can have, so you are able to make the
most informed decision about which will work for your clients.
2.3.1 Eyeshadow Finishes
Similar to foundation finishes, an eyeshadow finish describes how the pigment reflects in the light. There
can be eyeshadow finishes that do not reflect any light and appear flat, or some that are highly reflective.
As with many products, some brands may excel at certain finishes and fall flat in others. To avoid any
issues, always be sure to swatch your eyeshadow choices to make sure the transfer is ideal.
Matte Finish: Matte finish eyeshadows offer a flat finish, with little to no reflection of the light. They do
not contain any sheen or shimmer, which means they offer less highlighting effect on the area they are
applied. Matte finish shadows are often excellent options for contouring, because they cast a similar
shadow-like appearance. Look for options that are smooth and do not appear chalky.
Satin Finish: This option falls somewhere in the middle, and is not quite matte but also not extremely
reflective. Satin finish eyeshadows have a subtle sheen, and do not typically have a high-finish shine. This
shadow is great for a providing a subtle highlight, or for using one shade all over the lid.
Frost Finish: For a bit more high shine, a frost finish eye shadow is the way to go. These eyeshadows
intensify the look of the area they’re applied to, and appear almost metallic. These frost finish
eyeshadows do not contain glitter or sparkle, but their finely milled pigment adds intensity and drama to
a look.
Glitter Finish: These shadows follow their namesake, and contain glitter particles in the eyeshadow. The
glitter particles can vary in size from micro-glitter to larger and bolder glitter pieces. Glitter finish
eyeshadows are a fun option to add a bit of boldness to any look.

2.3.2 Warm vs. Cool Toned Eyeshadows
Many brides or clients will have an idea in mind for what they desire their eye makeup to look like. When
it comes to choosing the right shadows for your bride, it is important to understand what overall colour
tone they are looking to achieve. Warm and cool toned eyeshadows can create very different looks with
the same application, so here we will break down the main differences between the two colour tones and
some common colours you may encounter.
Warm Toned Eyeshadows: Warmer colours tend to incorporate primarily colours in the red, orange and
yellow colour families. Eyeshadows in this family can create a look that appears inviting and translate well
to the warmer seasons. A few common shades to look for in the warm tone include:
 Light Coral
 Peachy Nude
 Peachy Pinks
 Coral
 Nude Brown
 Warm Brown
 Bronze

Cool Toned Eyeshadows: Cool toned eyeshadows fall in the opposite realm of their warm counterparts,
and often encompass many blue, green and purple tones. They often look great in the fall and winter
seasons, and provide a calming appearance. Some common cool toned shades include:
 Beige
 Pale Pink
 Rosy Pink
 Pale Brown
 Deep Chocolate
 Deep Plum
 Taupe

2.4 Eyeliner
Most brides or clients will love the eye enhancing effects of eyeliner on their wedding or special event.
However, there are a number of different eyeliners and it can be hard to know which one to choose. Here
we will discuss the most common eyeliner formulas, and the pros and cons of each option.
Brush Tip Liquid Liner: This eyeliner type is a common one for wedding and event makeup, and for good
reason. The brush tip liquid liner offers very precise lines, and is great for creating a sharp and dramatic
line. Often these liners are able to provide thin lines, and usually offer a great pigmentation. The cons to
consider with the brush tip liquid liner include the time and difficulty when it comes to application.
Additionally, the liquid formula can often take some time to dry and varies on wear time.
Kohl Pencil: The original eyeliner, a kohl pencil can create a variety of looks and is very versatile. For
those brides or clients looking for a more smoked out lash line, a kohl pencil can create a smoldering
look. It is excellent for the waterline or tight-line, and goes on very easily. Since it goes on so easily, it can
often smudge extremely easily which may not be ideal for long events. The wear time can be short, and a
kohl pencil does not offer the most precise application.
Gel Eyeliner: Typically, in a glass pot, gel eyeliner is a great option for a deep and precise lash line. Gel
eyeliner requires a brush to apply, often an angled brush or liner brush. The texture of gel allows for a bit
more leniency when it comes to application, and it is a more precise option than a pencil form. When it
comes to wear time, gel eyeliner shines with a long wearing formula. The cons for gel liner include the
formula drying up, as well as some difficulty in achieving your ideal application.
Felt Tip Pen: One of the newer eyeliner options, felt tip eyeliner pens have become a go-to option for
those looking for a versatile and precise eyeliner. Because these pens are so easy to apply, they can offer
26 | P age
precision without much time for application. You can easily adjust the line, and felt tip pens are easy to
control. However, these options do not always offer the most deep or dramatic colour payoff, and can be
difficult to remove if needed.
2.5 Mascara
Similar to eyeliners, there are a number of different mascara wands that can drastically affect the end
result of your lashes. It is essential to choose a mascara that will be able to lengthen and thicken the
lashes of your bride or client. We will break down three key characteristics of each mascara wand shape,
to allow you to make the best decision of which to use.
Straight Brush
 Easy to use
 Fully coats lashes
 Access to both inner and outer lashes
Comb Brush
 Prevents eyelash clumping
 Separates the lashes
 Lengthening
27 | P age
Big Brush
 Gives major volume to lashes
 Thickens
 Applies more product than other wands
Small Brush
 Very precise
 Reaches each and every lash
 Great for tricky bottom lashes
Curved Brush
 Gives lashes more curl
 Lifts lashes from base
 Volumizes
Sphere Brush
 Reaches each lash individually
 Provides custom lengthening
 More precise application

2.6 False Eyelashes
For many brides and clients attending special events, they will be looking to wear false eyelashes for their
big day. False eyelashes are an excellent way to add a bit of drama to the eyes, and enhance them.
Events and weddings are the perfect time to suggest false lashes to your clients, but it is important to
know which ones will look best and how to apply them. Here, we will provide details on choosing the
shape of your false lashes and the best technique to apply them.
2.6.1 False Eyelashes Shapes
Remember the eye shapes we discussed earlier in this module? Those eye shapes will help you
determine which false lashes will work best for your client. By choosing a false lash that accentuates the
shape of their eye, you will help define and enhance the eye makeup look you have already completed.
Lashes should be your finishing touch, so you want them to make the total makeup look perfect.
29 | P age
 Monolid - For monolids, you can choose nearly any shape of false lash to enhance the eye.
We recommend an option that fans out to help even out the eyelids and provide some
definition.
 Upturned - Because upturned eyes already have a natural cat eye look, opt for a pair of
lashes that are nearly the same length across. This will provide more balance across your
upper lid, and will still give you a dramatic look along the lash line.
 Downturned - Downturned eyes have the slight droop in the outer corner, so to combat this
go for a pair that is a cat eye shape in the outer corner. By drawing the lashes upwards in
the corner, you will provide a natural lift to the outer eye to help even out the look of the
eye makeup.
 Round - Since round eyes already have a circular shape, choose a pair of false lashes that are
long and fan upwards. Choose a pair that provide natural definition, and may even be
longest in the middle. Avoid any heavy looking false lashes, as those can make your eyes
appear smaller.
 Almond - To accentuate the symmetry of almond eyes, reach for a pair that gets longer and
more wispy towards the outer corner. You can try a demi strip that only goes on the outer
corner, or try a set of voluminous false eyelashes that fan outwards.
 Hooded - By selecting the right pair of false eyelashes, you can frame hooded eyes and draw
attention to the lid. Opt for a pair that is longest in the middle, with dimension and texture
between the long and short lash strands. They should have a natural looking weight and
volume to keep from making your eyes look too heavy.
30 | P age
2.6.2 How to Apply False Lashes
By following a few easy steps, you can apply false lashes perfectly on every client for their wedding or
special occasion.
3. Apply Mascara - Curl your eyelashes, and apply 1 to 2 coats of mascara on the top and
bottom lashes. This will help your lashes blend in to the false lashes, and create a shelf for
the false lashes to rest on.
4. Trim Lashes - To ensure the lashes fit each eye, gently place the lashes on the eye (without
any adhesive) to determine how much needs to be trimmed. Many false lashes are bigger
than the average eye, so by trimming the lashes you can ensure it lays perfectly without any
excess.
5. Apply Adhesive - Using your lash glue of choice, apply an extremely thin line all across the
band of the false eyelashes. Be sure to check with your client for any allergies, as many false
lash glue contains latex.
6. Let Glue Dry - This is the most important step in the process. It is critical to let the adhesive
dry until it gets tacky, so that the eyelash doesn’t slide around on the eyelid.
7. Place Lashes Along Lash Line - Gently place your false lashes as close to the lash line as
possible, so they almost blend together. Keep the eyes looking down while the glue settles,
and adjust as needed until the lash adhesive dries completely.

2.7 Factors to Consider When Choosing Bridal or Event Eye Makeup
When it comes down to working with a bride or client for a wedding or special event, you will likely play a
key role in helping them decide what their makeup may look like. In order to help make this decision,
there are a few factors to consider ensuring it is the best option for your bride or client.
3. Dress or Outfit - To determine how eye makeup should appear, consider the style of the
wedding dress or event apparel your client will be wearing. If their dress is more bold or
contemporary, you may be able to experiment with a more dramatic eye makeup look.
Contrastingly, if the dress is more of a romantic style, go for a more subtle and natural look
with neutral shades. The makeup should match the feel of the outfit your client is wearing,
so be sure to inquire about the style of their dress or apparel.
4. Location - When choosing an eye makeup palette and look, take into account the location of
the event or wedding. If the event is outdoors, you may need to alter the colour palette or
style of the eye makeup you apply. A formal ballroom wedding will likely require a bit more
of a formal and dramatic look. If the event is a casual affair, opt for natural shades with
excellent application. Determining the venue will help you choose the best option to match
your client’s big day.
5. Event Style - Similar to location, the style of the wedding or event will dramatically change
the makeup choices you make. A country or boho wedding may require a more neutral
palette with less harsh application. Contrastingly, if your client is attending a black tie affair
it may be appropriate to go for a dramatic eye look to match the style. You want your client
to feel comfortable on their big day, so sticking to a style they enjoy will allow them to feel
their best.
6. Season - The time of year your client’s wedding or event is taking place may help you
determine which eye makeup to choose. A spring wedding may be the perfect time to play
with a more pastel toned eyeshadow palette, whereas a summer wedding may be a great
time for bronze tones or corals. On the other hand, a fall wedding may be a great time for
plums, and a winter event would make a great palette for jewel tones. The palettes of the
seasons change, so why not match the makeup with it?

Lips, Cheeks & Brows
Now that you’ve learned how to create a flawless face and beautiful eye makeup for your bride or client,
it’s important to finish off the rest of the face! Weddings and special event makeup is not complete
without finishing off the lips, cheeks and brows. In this module, you will learn about the many different
product options for lip, cheek and brow products, and best practices when it comes to proper
application. These steps will be the finishing touches for your makeup application, and will complete your
bride or client’s makeup look for their big day!
3.1 Lips
For weddings and special events, having a beautiful lip can pull the entire look together. When choosing
which makeup to apply on your bride or client, it is essential to understand the basics of the many
different types of lip products, along with the main lipstick finishes and formulas. In this section, you will
learn the many details of lip products and the best application tips.
3.1.1 Lip Products
Nearly every day there are new lip products being released, and it can be hard to keep up and know
which ones will work. Your clients will have many different needs and desires, so it is critical to
understand the many different products and how each of them works. By knowing the pros and cons
between all of the different lip products, you can make the best choice to achieve the best look for your
bride or client.
34 | P age
Lipstick - Lipstick is one of the most basic makeup products, and is an essential in any makeup bag. You
can find lipstick in nearly every colour, finish and formula, making it extremely versatile depending on
which lipstick you choose. Lipstick is an excellent option for makeup artists looking to find a large variety
of options with one product. They are highly pigmented, and provide an easy application with relatively
little room for error. Lipstick is suitable for any age or skin tone, and typically isn’t sticky or tacky.
However, the large variety of lipsticks can make it difficult to know which formula or finish will be best for
you. Additionally, depending on which lipstick you choose it can wear off somewhat quickly.
Lip Liner - Lip liner is typically used underneath another lip product, and can serve a number of purposes.
One benefit of lip liner is that it can prevent product from bleeding into the fine lines around the lips. Lip
liner can also prolong the wear time of a lip product, by providing a base for the product against the lips.
Another way lip liner can be used is to alter or enhance the shape of the lips. You can use lip liner to
make the lips look bigger, smaller or symmetrical. Lip liner offers precision and is much pigmented, but
can be somewhat drying on the lips. Unfortunately, it can take a steady hand to apply bold lip liner
colours, so be careful with your application.
Lip Gloss - Lip gloss is a youthful and easy way to add some shine to the lips. Lip gloss comes
in many options, and can provide a number of finishes to the lips. You can find glosses that
offer a creamy texture, glitter, shine or shimmer. Lip gloss is easy to apply, and offers a wide
variety of colours and textures. It provides a youthful, healthy look to the lips and can be
layered on top of other lip products. Some lip glosses can unfortunately wear off fairly
quickly, so they require frequent reapplying.
35 | P age
Lip Balm - Traditionally designed to moisturize the lips, lip balms can come in either a sheer
or tinted pigmentation. Lip balms can serve as a great base for the lips, and are extremely
easy to apply. If you choose a tinted option, it can offer a subtle wash of colour that gives a
natural flush to the lips. Plus, your lips will never look dry when wearing a lip balm!
However, if you’re looking for more of an impact a lip balm will not provide much pigment
for you, and they can wear off fairly quickly.
Liquid Lipstick - This product has the consistency and texture of a gloss, but is highly
pigmented and dries down to a lipstick feel. Liquid lipsticks have recently been gaining
popularity, so there are a large variety of colours and finishes on the market. The best
benefit to liquid lipstick is the long lasting formula, and the extreme colour payoff from the
pigmentation. The formulas can vary between brands, so it is important to do research or
test out the products before using on a client. Liquid lipsticks are easy to apply, and are
great for events where there will be little to no options for touch ups. Liquid lipsticks can be
drying on the lips, so it is important to exfoliate the lips before using.
Lip Stains - Lip stains are designed to be extremely long lasting on the lips, since they
actually stain the top layer of your lips. They have a fairly consistent finish, and often the
colour range is limited. Lip stains are extremely long lasting, and provide a natural stain to
the lips. They don’t offer high pigmentation, but for those looking for a more natural colour
36 | P age
this is a great option. Lip stains can be drying on the lips, and it can be difficult to remove if
there are mistakes.
3.1.2 Lipstick Finishes
Now that you’re knowledgeable of the many different lip products, we will dive into the most common -
lipstick. Lipstick is the original lip product, and is a makeup artist staple. For bridal and special occasion
makeup, it is important to understand which lipstick finish will work best for your bride or client’s needs.
Here we will cover the most common lipstick finishes, and educate you on the pros and cons of each
finish.
Matte Finish - Similar to other matte products, matte lipstick has a flat finish with no shine or reflection.
Often, matte lipsticks are a long wearing option and can provide great pigmentation. Matte lipsticks will
appear smooth or velvet-like on the lips, and apply evenly across the lips. Occasionally, matte lipsticks
can be drying so it may be beneficial to exfoliate or apply lip balm prior to use.
Creamy Finish - A creamy finish lipstick will provide more shine than a matte formula, and are often more
comfortable on the lips. They do not dry out the lips, but still provide a good wear time. Typically, creamy
lipsticks have strong pigmentation and wear evenly throughout the day. Creamy lipsticks can sometimes
bleed into the fine lines around the lips, so creamy lipsticks can benefit from the use of a lip liner around
the edges of the lips.
Satin Finish - Satin lipsticks offer a subtle sheen to the lips, and are a very comfortable lipstick to wear.
They keep the lips hydrated, and offer a very versatile finish for a wide range of colours. Satin lipsticks
37 | P age
offer a natural shine to the lips, without appearing too dramatic. When it comes to lipstick finishes, satin
lipsticks are some of the most universally flattering and are a great choice for bridal or special events
makeup.
Amplified Finish - For those looking for a bold lip with extreme colour payoff, amplified finish lipsticks will
be a perfect option. Amplified lipsticks are highly pigmented, and typically offer a long wear time. They
are smooth on the lips, and don’t dry your lips out in the same way that matte lipsticks do. However,
amplified finish lipsticks can often stain the area they are applied to, so it is important to be careful when
applying.
3.1.3 Perfect Lip Application
With your knowledge of the many different lip products, you can now move on to mastering the perfect
application. For bridal and special event makeup, it is important to understand how to receive a precise
application for your bride or client. There are a few easy steps that you can take to prepare the lips, and
apply lip products to achieve a flawless look. Here, we will break down the most important steps to
achieve the perfect lip application.
3. Exfoliate the lips to remove any dead skin, and create a smooth base for your lip products.
You can exfoliate the lips by using a lip scrub, DIY sugar scrub or by lightly brushing a dry
toothbrush against the lips. This will also stimulate blood flow, and make the lips appear
fuller.
4. Moisturize the lips by using a hydrating lip balm. The easiest way to do this with your bride
or client is by applying a moisturizing lip balm at the beginning of your makeup application,
and let the lips soak in the hydration while you complete the rest of the makeup. It will
soften the lips and ensure any lip products go on smoothly.
38 | P age
3. Apply lip liner around the outer edges of your lip, and slightly fill in the outer corners. You
can use a coloured lip liner to go with your lipstick colour, or opt for a lip liner that matches
the tone of your lips to simply enhance your client’s natural shape. This will ensure your
lipstick doesn’t bleed, and can help increase the wear time of your lip products.
4. Next, take your lip product of choice (lipstick, liquid lipstick, lip stain) and apply it. You can
use a brush for a precise application, or you can apply straight from the tube. Begin applying
in the Cupid’s bow, and work your way out slowly and precisely.
5. If your bride or client is applying a bold or highly pigmented colour, now may be the best
time to go back and clean up the edges of your lips. Using a small concealer or lip brush,
apply a flesh toned concealer around the edges of the lip on the skin. This will give a crisp
and precise edge to the lip, and is perfect for correcting any small mistakes made during the
application process.
6. Finish off the look with an optional gloss to add shine and luster to the lips. Not all clients
may want a glossy look, so feel free to skip this step if it doesn’t align with the desires of
your client. However, adding a gloss on top can create a beautiful, youthful look and is great
for many weddings and special events.
3.2 Cheeks
When we discuss cheeks in this section, we are also covering the extra steps a makeup artist
can take to complete the face. Not only does this include blush, but also bronzer and
highlighter which can be excellent additions to a makeup look. When it comes to these
39 | P age
products, there are a number of different options for choices and application techniques.
We will cover each one separately, and discuss how you can put them all together to
complete the face.
3.2.1 Blush
Blush is an essential step for adding colour back into the face after applying foundation, and
can give the “blushing bride” look that many brides strive for. When it comes to choosing
the right blush and applying it correctly, there are a few factors that can help you decide
which product to use. We will cover some of the key considerations when it comes to
blushes, and also discuss best practices for great blush application every time.
1. Choose Your Formula - Blush typically comes in two different formulas, powder or
cream. Both formulas offer a number of benefits, and it is important to know when is
the right time to reach for one or the other. Powder blushes are a bit more subtle,
and are easier to blend into the skin (especially over other powder products).
Powder blush can be easier to apply, and is great for those with oily or combination
skin. On the other hand, cream blush is excellent for those with dry skin, or people
who have issues with their skin’s texture. Cream blushes are a bit more difficult to
apply, and give more of a dewy look to the skin. They can tend to be more
pigmented, so it is important to take a light hand if reaching for cream blush.
2. Choose Your Colour - Like many other makeup products, blushes come in a wide
array of colours to choose from. It may seem overwhelming to choose the best
shade for your bride or client, but there are a few easy ways to narrow down your
choices. Much of these choices come down to your bride or client’s skin tone. A good
rule of thumb is that darker skin tones will require a deeper pigment, and lighter skin
tones will need lighter pigments. You’ve already learned about warm and cool toned
colours, and the same rules can be applied to blush! For warm tones, opt for a
peach or coral blush. Cool tones should reach for pink or plum based shades.
40 | P age
3.2.2 Bronzer
Many people will be looking to have a bit of a sun kissed glow on the day of their wedding or special
event, and bronzer will be your go to product in achieving this. However, bronzer can be a bit tricky
because you don’t want your client to end up looking muddy or unnatural. Because of this, it is important
to know which bronzers to choose for each client. It is also important to understand the best ways to
apply bronzer to achieve your client’s desired look.
Choose Your Finish - Bronzers come in a variety of options, so you will need to make a few decisions to
pick the ideal one. First, decide whether you would like to have a bronzer with shimmer or matte.
Shimmer bronzers can offer a luminescent look, but too much can make a face look unnatural. On the
other hand, matte bronzers are excellent for contouring and a natural glow, but the wrong shade can
make the face look muddy.
Choose Your Shade - It may seem like bronzer is a one size fits all shade, but that is certainly not the case.
Lighter skin will require a much different shade than darker skin, so use your client’s skin tone as the base
for choosing the colour shade. To create a natural glow, choose a shade that is 1-2 shades darker than
your client’s skin tone. If you’re opting to contour, choose a shade that is 2-3 shades darker. Keep in
mind, it is better to go lighter and build up the colour than start off too dark.
Choose Your Application - Your application technique with bronzer will depend on what you are using
the bronzer for. If your goal is to provide a natural glow, the best route is to sweep a light bronzer on a
fluffy brush. Apply the bronzer anywhere the sun would naturally hit your face - your temples,
cheekbones or jawline. This technique is often referred to as the “3/E”, because you can imagine dusting
the bronzer in the shape of a three or “E” on the sides of your face. The other option to apply bronzer is
to contour, which helps enhance the shape of the face. To contour, use the darker shade of bronzer and a
dense, angled face brush to apply the bronzer. Use this to darken any areas that you want to appear
shadowed, including the temples, hollows of the cheeks or jawline. You can even contour the sides of the
nose to make the nose appear smaller.
41 | P age
3.2.3 Highlighter
Adding highlighter to a makeup look can make the skin look luminous and radiant, but it is often an
overlooked step. Many times highlighter can offer that “lit from within” glow that many people are
looking for on their wedding or special occasion. Choosing the right highlighter is important, along with
proper application to achieve the perfect look. Here, we will cover the basics of highlighters, and
application best practices.
Choose Your Formula - Highlighter comes in many forms, including cream, liquid and powder. All three
provide different benefits, and can create stunning highlights on the skin. Cream highlighters are
excellent for those with dry skin, and give a dewy look when applied. Liquid highlighters offer precision
where they are applied, and are also great for mixing in with foundation. Lastly, powder is the easiest to
apply and blends flawlessly into the skin.
42 | P age
Choose Your Shade - Like most makeup products, there isn’t one shade that works for every skin tone.
Most highlighters come in two shades - gold based or silver based. For clients with warmer skin tones, the
gold based highlighters will accentuate the warmth in the skin, and are great for brides or clients with a
darker skin tone. Silver based highlighters are great for those with lighter skin, or cooler skin tones.
Choose Your Application - Since the purpose of highlighters is to make the skin look naturally glowy with
great complexion, it is best to go for a natural application. You can apply highlighter anywhere that you
want to accentuate, so it is best to go for the high planes of the face. The tops of the cheekbones up
towards the temple, the brow bone, inner corner of the eyes, down the nose and in your cupid’s bow are
all some of the best places to apply highlighter.
3.3 Eyebrows
Eyebrows frame the eyes, so it is essential to ensure they look their best when applying makeup. Defined
brows can completely change the look of the face, and it is your job as the makeup artist to finish off your
client’s look with beautiful and defined eyebrows. We will break down the main brow products and their
uses, as well as a few simple steps to achieve perfectly defined brows.
3.3.1 Eyebrow Products
There are a number of products that one could use on the eyebrows, but by knowing a few of the basics
you can choose the best product for your client. When it comes to bridal and special event makeup, your
client wants a completed look including perfect brows. We will share the best products to achieve
defined eyebrows, and when to use each one.
43 | P age
Pencils - Eyebrow pencils have been a long-time favourite product in achieving defined brows. They can
help with filling in sparse areas of the brow, and can help create a hair like effect if used correctly. Look
for a brow pencil that applies easily to the skin, but isn’t going to fade throughout the day. Typically a
waxy formula with a very fine point will help achieve the most realistic look.
Powders - Using a powder in the brows can help create a more natural appearance. Typically they give a
softer look in the brows, and are great for those who are a little heavy handed with a pencil. Brow
powders are applied with an angled brush, and provide a bit more room for error during the application
process.
Pomades - Eyebrow pomades can create an amazing effect in the brows, but are a bit more difficult to
apply. Their cream-based formula provides strong colour pigmentation, and is great for those who want a
bold, strong brow. Also applied with an angled brush, pomades require a light hand to keep them looking
natural.
3.3.2 Eyebrow Application
Once you understand how each eyebrow product works, you can choose the one that is best for your
bride or client. Creating perfectly defined brows can be easy and effective if done correctly. There are a
few simple steps to create perfectly defined eyebrows, and once mastered it will take you only a few
minutes.
44 | P age
1. Basic Grooming - If there are any stray or errant hairs outside of the natural brow line, be
sure to tweeze or wax those for your client prior to application. Don’t go overboard with this
step, and only tweeze hairs that are truly outside of the brow.
2. Determine Shape - It is important to know where your brows should start and end when
filling in the eyebrows. Place a makeup brush along the side of your nose straight up, and
where the brush meets your brow is where your brows should start. Angle the brush to the
outer corner of your eye, and where the brow intersects is where it should end.
3. Define Edges - Start filling in the brows by defining the start and end of your brows, as well
as defining the arch. These are the key areas of the eyebrow, and will serve as a frame for
the rest of your brow product.
4. Fill In - Once you’ve set up the definition for your brows, start filling in the other areas. Use
short, hair like strokes to achieve the most natural look while still creating definition.
5. Finish - You can finish off your final eyebrow look by setting the brows with a clear brow gel,
or simply running a spoolie through the end result. This will help set the brows in place, and
ensure they look perfectly defined all day long.

Special Considerations for Weddings & Events
Now that you understand how to apply the perfect bridal and special event makeup, it is important to
take into consideration many of the special circumstances that may occur at such events. You want the
makeup you apply to be flawless in all regards for your client’s big day, so you often need to adjust your
products or application to account for the nuances of weddings and special events. In this module, you’ll
learn how to maximize your makeup for photography, lighting and how it can affect your makeup and
tips and tricks to increase the durability of your makeup.
4.1 Photography
For most weddings and special events, there will be many photographs being taken of your client.
Especially for events where photos are a large part of the occasion, it is essential to know how your
makeup will photograph. If you’re putting all the work into creating a flawless makeup application for
your bride or client, you want it to show up just as beautiful in the photos. Here we’ll dive into some of
the most important things to know when doing makeup for photography.
4.1.1 Face Makeup for Photography
Since you are now an expert on creating the perfect face for your client, it is critical to know a few
important tips to ensure that flawless face transfers beautifully in photos. There are a few key things to
know when it comes to face makeup, and we will dive deeper into those areas here.
Foundation: When choosing a foundation to use for photographs, you want your foundation to appear as
accurate on camera as possible. Unfortunately, there are a few ingredients and foundation types that do
not photograph well. Avoid foundations with SPF in them, as one of the key ingredients can appear white
in photos. Similarly, some mineral foundations can cast an unnatural “glow” over the face when
photographed. Ever notice photos where the person’s face seems surprisingly white compared to the rest
of their body? That is likely because they used a foundation that was not optimized for photography. If
you have clients who are extremely concerned about their foundation in photographs, opt for a
foundation labeled “photo ready” or “HD” to ensure it’ll reflect well in photos.

Powder: Photography, especially if there is a flash, will pick up on any reflective part of the face. If there
is any oil on the face it will be accentuated in photos, which most people do not prefer. To combat this,
be sure to set your foundation with a matte powder (either pressed or translucent) to remove any shine
or oil. If you are looking to take it one step further, use oil absorbing blotting papers to remove any oil
without needing to reapply more makeup.
Bronzer: Photography can wash out much of the structural definition of the face, so contouring with a
matte bronzer is very important to keep that definition in photos. Use an angled brush with a matte
bronzer, and apply anywhere you would like to preserve the definition of your face. Typically, this
includes the hollows of the cheeks, temples, jawline and sides of the nose. You can contrast this by
adding highlighter to further accentuate the face’s definition.
Blush: Since we already know photography can wash out the definition in the face, the same applies to
colour. You want to ensure your bride or client keeps some colour in their face in photos, and blush will
be critical in achieving this. When applying makeup for photography, apply a colour that will provide a
natural flush to look like a healthy glow on camera. You may need to choose a deeper colour than
normal, but you still want your client to look beautiful in person so don’t overdo the colour.

4.1.2 Eye Makeup for Photography
In photography, it is important to play up the eyes to ensure they don’t get lost in the photograph. You
will want to choose appropriate colours and finishes for your event, to make your photos look as flawless
as possible. It’s also important to use best practices for eyeliner and mascara, to complete the full eye
look.
Eyeshadow: When applying eyeshadow for photography, it is critical to make the eyes stand out. Avoid
using too much shimmer or glitter in photos, as it can look unnatural or distracting. Instead, opt for matte
and satin finishes to enhance the eyes while translating well to photos. Choose colours that are neutral
and timeless, rather than flashy or trendy. Your bride or client may think they want the “colour of the
moment”, but if it seems like a colour that will be dated in five years it is not the best choice. Be sure to
blend as much as possible, to avoid any harsh lines that may be picked up by the camera.
Eyeliner: When it comes to eyeliner and photography, there is a fine line that must be towed carefully.
You want to define the eyes and enhance the lash line, but too much eyeliner can actually make the eyes
look smaller in photos. To achieve the perfect look, go for a thicker line on the top in a black or brown
colour. Tightline the upper lashline in the black or brown, but instead use a nude or white coloured liner
on the waterline. This will make the eyes appear larger, and also prevent any redness from showing in the
photos.
Mascara: For photography, having a defined and thick lash line can really enhance the eyes. This would
be a perfect opportunity to apply false eyelashes, along with a great mascara. Follow the information
listed in module two, but consider using a more natural looking false lash for photos. If it is too heavy, it
can shrink the appearance of the eyes in photos, rather than enlarging them.

4.2 Lighting
Lighting can make a huge difference when applying your makeup, and it is important to understand how
to adjust when working on brides or clients. There are some key tips and tricks when it comes to applying
makeup in varying lighting, and they can make a big difference in how your makeup will look when
working on a bride or client for their wedding or special event.
4.2.1 Makeup in Natural Light
Of all lighting options, natural lighting is the very best for creating the most natural and universally
flattering application. Natural lighting provides the most realistic vision of how makeup will look, and
transfers the best through many different lighting options. If at all possible, apply your makeup in natural
lighting to achieve the most flattering option for you bride or client. The most common option is to apply
your makeup in front of a large window, which will allow natural light to hit all aspects of the face.
Natural lighting helps to achieve the best application, so if at all possible opt to apply your makeup in a
location with natural lighting.
50 | P age
4.2.2 Makeup for artificial lighting
If you must apply makeup using artificial lighting, there are a few easy ways you can make it appear as
natural as possible. The first major option is to find a lighting source that will add additional lighting for
your application. If you can add an option that will light a multitude of angles, that will help diffuse the
lighting for a natural application. The best options are to position lights across different sides of the face,
and even opt for one that will illuminate under the chin. If at all possible, avoid lights that illuminate only
the area above the head. Overhead lighting can create unnecessary shadow and wrinkles, which will
make your makeup application less natural and realistic.
4.3 Durability
When applying makeup for special events and weddings, it is essential that the makeup be durable
throughout the event. You don’t want to spend the time and effort to apply the perfect makeup look for
your client, and have it end up looking worn or disfigured by the end of the day. When it comes to
makeup application, there are a few products that can make a major difference in how your makeup
lasts. Primers will be essential when creating long lasting makeup, so here we will break down the most
common primers to use on your bride or client to enhance their makeup’s durability.
4.3.1 Skin Prep
Before diving into primers, it is important to stress the importance of preparing the skin for makeup. You
learned all about this in module one, but when it comes to increasing the durability of makeup it is a
crucial step. To ensure the skin is ready for makeup, complete a thorough exfoliation and hydration prior
to applying any product.
51 | P age
4.3.2 Primers
When it comes to durability, primers will be the essential product to ensure the makeup you apply lasts
all day long. Nearly every makeup product has a corresponding primer, but only some will be worth the
extra time, money and application. In this section, we will break down the most common primers and
share what you should be looking for in each.
Face Primers: The most common priming product is a facial primer, which goes underneath foundation to
prep the skin for makeup. Face primers commonly come in two forms, both of which help increase the
longevity of makeup. The first is a priming spray, which applies an even mist all over the face. The second
is a liquid or gel primer, which you can apply all over the skin to prep skin for makeup. A common
ingredient in face primers is silicone, but there are many silicone free primers for clients who may have
an allergy. Face primers help fill in pores, fine lines and wrinkles, and also provide a smooth surface for
foundation to be applied. Especially for clients with oily skin, primer will be a critical product as it can
help diminish the production of oil on the face. If you are going to use any primer on the skin, a facial
primer is typically the most versatile and commonly used.
52 | P age
Eye Primers: When it comes to eye makeup, nothing enhances the look of eyeshadow like an eye primer.
Eye primers can enhance the colour of eyeshadow, and help with application and diminish fall out.
Additionally, eye primers help prevent creasing and oiliness on the eyelids. You can find eye primers in
two pigmentation options, both great for applying eyeshadow on top of. The first is an eye primer that
applies clear, and simply serves as a nice base for makeup without adding any colour or pigment. The
second option is an eyeshadow primer that has pigmentation and colour. You can get this option in some
skin toned options to help even out the skin tone, or an option that will correspond with the eyeshadow
you are applying to enhance the colour. Either option will help prime the lids, prevent creasing and
enhance shadow colour, which is great for bridal and special occasion makeup.
Lip primers: Similar to a Chapstick or lip balm, lip primers typically apply as a clear consistency to go
underneath makeup. Primarily, lip primers are used to help prevent feathering of lip product or bleeding
into the fine lines around the lips. If your client has aging skin or an extremely bold lip, a lip primer will be
an excellent option for their lip product application. Don’t forget, you can achieve a similar result by using
a long wearing lip liner with a long wearing lipstick. Choosing the right lip products, specifically long
wearing products, can make the biggest difference in the longevity of your lipstick.
53 | P age
4.3.3 Finishing Sprays
To finish off your completed makeup look, a finishing spray is the essential last step. Makeup finishing
sprays offer a mist of product that sets the makeup, and gives the completed look a natural finish. Some
makeup finishing sprays can help mattify the face, and prevent oil production throughout the day.
Additionally, they can help lock in the makeup and ensure it will wear evenly throughout your event or
wedding. Look for a makeup finishing spray that is intended to work on the skin type of your client, as
some can be made for oily skin versus dry skin. A makeup finishing spray is the perfect way to set your
makeup and finish off your completed look.
Conclusion
In this module you’ve learned many of the special considerations that occur when doing makeup for
weddings and special occasions. There are a number of factors that can affect how your makeup appears,
and it is important to adjust your application techniques accordingly. For events and weddings,
photography is often a major component of the day. You will want to adjust your makeup application to
best reflect in photos. Similarly, lighting can make a major difference in how the face and makeup
appears. Lastly, you want the makeup you apply to be durable and last throughout the entire wedding or
event. These special considerations can ensure that your makeup looks flawless during any time
throughout the wedding or occasion.

Bridal & Special Occasion Makeup as a business
Now that you’ve mastered the perfect makeup application for bridal and special occasion makeup, you
are able to take your learnings and apply them to build a thriving business.
Whether makeup is a hobby or your means of income, your knowledge can be applied to create a
business or side project if you so desire.
For those looking to build up the business side of their bridal and special occasion makeup, we will
discuss some of the key elements of a business in this final module.
5.1 Finding Clientele
Obviously the first critical step in creating a business in bridal and special occasion makeup is to find
clients! Without clients, there really is no business or work to be done. However, it may seem daunting
to find new clients. Since clientele are critical to make money and growing your bridal and special
55 | P age
occasion makeup business, we will discuss a few key ways that you can find clientele and gain
momentum in your business.
5.1.1 Wedding Fairs, Websites & Other Resources
There are a number of different resources that can be helpful in reaching potential brides and clients.
Your future clients need to find you before they could ever hire you, so it is important to make your bridal
and special occasion makeup business known to your potential client. By utilizing some resources, you
can position yourself to find your ideal client and begin getting paid to do bridal and special occasion
makeup.
 Wedding Websites - There are a number of different wedding websites that also serve as an
easy way for brides to find vendors and makeup artists for their big day. Do some research
on which wedding websites and boards your ideal client is utilizing to help plan their
wedding, and submit your information to be included in the vendor listings? Brides or clients
in your area will come across your information, and you will gain much more exposure than
simply by word of mouth.
 Wedding Fairs - Another great way to meet your ideal client is by signing up to attend any
wedding fairs or bridal shows in your area. The people attending these events are in the
process of planning their wedding, and they are often attending in hopes of finding vendors,
hairstylists, photographers or makeup artists for their wedding. By attending these events,
you will have the chance to meet your ideal client in person and explain why you are best
suited to help them on their big day. Additionally, wedding fairs and shows are an excellent
way to network with other professionals in the wedding industry. You never know when a
56 | P age
hairstylist may get asked about their recommendation for a makeup artist, and by
networking you can be top of mind.
 Personal Website - If you are looking to get serious about growing your bridal and special
occasion business, it will be important to have your own website. A website is one of the
first places a potential client will check, and by having one you are able to show off your
previous work and list your contact information for inquiries. Additionally, it is an excellent
way for brides to find you online. If someone searches “wedding makeup artist” in relation
to your city or location, a website will help you appear during those searches by potential
clients.
 Social Media - Similar to a personal website, it is critical to have active and professional
social media accounts for your bridal or special occasion makeup business. These social
media accounts can serve as a resource for potential clients in viewing your work, and it is
another great way for potential clients to find you. Social media accounts help to establish a
personal brand for yourself and your business, and social media is an easy way to stay
connected with past, current and future clients.
57 | P age
5.1.2 The Importance of Referrals
Of all the methods for obtaining new clients for your bridal and special occasion makeup business,
referrals are the easiest and most effective way. Potential clients are far more likely to hire a vendor or
makeup artist if they know someone who had a great experience. Additionally, referrals from other
wedding professionals can be critical in finding new clients for your makeup. Don’t be afraid to ask for
referrals from friends, family or past clients. Letting those people know that you are currently taking on
additional clients will ensure they think of you first when recommending a bridal or special occasion
makeup artist. Additionally, you can offer a small gift or complimentary service to those who refer you to
a paying client. This method increases the likelihood of referrals, and promotes a positive emotion for all
parties involved.
5.1.3 Creating a Portfolio
One of the key pieces to prepare when looking for clients is a portfolio. A portfolio often consists of
photos of your previous work, and can be shown to potential clients to give them an idea of your makeup
application style and results. To create your portfolio, begin taking photos of your completed makeup
looks after every makeup application. Additionally, you can utilize the photos from the wedding or special
event for your portfolio (with permission from the event photographer or proper credit). Don’t have any
photos to put in a portfolio? Consider doing some complimentary or discounted makeup looks for
friends or family to help build up your portfolio. They can serve as the “models”, and you will be able to
use the photos to build out your portfolio in order to obtain new paying clients.
58 | P age
5.2 Preparing for the Event
As the makeup artist, it is your responsibility to be well prepared for the big day of the wedding or special
event. By taking a few simple steps and answering a few key questions, you can help the day of the event
go smoothly and easily. It is always wise to prepare for your makeup application, and here we will break
down what you should be doing and asking prior to the wedding or special occasion.
59 | P age
5.2.1 Gather Information
After a client has chosen you to do their makeup for their wedding or special occasion, it is important to
take some time to get to know the client, the event and their goals for the makeup application. Knowing
these things ahead of time will help you come into the event prepared, and will assist with ensuring the
event goes seamlessly with no major issues. Many of these questions prepare not only you, but can help
set expectations with your bride or client. Here are a few key questions that may be helpful to you when
working with a client:
 Tell me about yourself?
 Describe your upcoming wedding or event?
 What size of bridal party do you have? Will they be requiring makeup application as well?
 Will you be looking for makeup application for the mother of the bride? Mother of the
groom? Flower girl?
 What are some examples of the makeup style you’d be looking for?
 How do you typically apply your makeup on a normal day?
 What is the colour palette of your wedding or special event?
 What brands/products do you currently use on a daily basis?
 What type of photography or videography will you be using?
 Describe your skin type?
 Do you have any skin allergies or concerns?
 What location are you hoping to have the makeup applied?
 Do you have any veils or accessories you are hoping to incorporate?
 What method of payment will you be using?
 When would you like to schedule your trial run?
60 | P age
5.2.2 Trial Run
You may have noticed the final question above is in relation to a trial run. Trial runs are essential in
ensuring that your makeup application on the day of the event is to the bride or client’s expectations.
Consider the trial run a “test drive” for the wedding or event, and they serve as a benefit for both you
and the client. It ensures that your makeup style is a good fit for your client’s, and will help cut down on
time on the day of the event.
Typically, it is a good idea to schedule the trial run with plenty of time in advance to ensure you
understand and master the look that your client is aiming for. Be sure to incorporate any special
accessories they may be looking to use on the day of the event. This will also allow plenty of time to
communicate with your client on any things that they may want changed or modified for the wedding or
event. You can either charge extra for a trial run, or include the trial run in the cost for your total package
for the wedding or special event.

5.3 Creating Your Makeup Kit
As a makeup artist, it is highly important to create a makeup “kit” that will serve as your toolbox for your
bridal and special occasion makeup business. Because of germs and sanitation, it is not wise to use your
personal makeup on a client. Instead, you will want to gather special makeup, tools, skin care and
accessories to use specifically on clients for your bridal and special occasion makeup business. You will
need to be strategic about which products you pick up for your kit, to ensure you will have makeup that
works for every skin type, makeup look or colour tone. Keep in mind that as your business grows, you can
continue to grow your makeup kit and build your products. Here we’ll share a few of the basic options for
building out your makeup kit for your bridal and special occasion makeup business.
62 | P age
5.3.1 Kit Essentials
Obviously the basis of your business will come down to the makeup application, so it is important to have
some essential makeup and skin care items in your makeup kit. You will want these items to be versatile,
and as universally flattering as possible. Here we’ll break down a few suggestions for skin care, face, eye,
lip, cheek and eyebrow makeup items.
5.3.1.1 Kit Essentials – Face Makeup
When it comes to creating your makeup kit, face makeup will require the most investment to ensure you
have something for every skin type and colouring. You will want a full range of colours in your kit, or
products that can mix to create a custom colour for your client.
 Foundation - If looking for a universal option, there are some palettes that contain a variety
of foundation colours that you can use for nearly any client. You can also pick up a few key
colours and finishes, and plan to mix them to create a custom formula for your clients. Find a
few foundation formulas in each finish, and pick up a variety of shades that could work on a
large number of clients.
 Concealer - Similar to foundation, you will want to have concealer in a few different shades.
It is much more common to find concealer palettes, which often contain a number of flesh
toned colours and a few correcting shades. These palettes will offer you options for a variety
of clients and help minimize the number of individual concealers you would need to
purchase.
 Powder - Pressed pigmented powders are not as easy to mix colours, so it would be wise to
pick up either a palette or a few individual pressed powders to use on your clients. The most
universal option will be a translucent powder, which does not need to be colour matched to
any specific skin tone.
63 | P age
5.3.1.2 Kit Essentials – Eye Makeup
For eye makeup, it will be important to have a variety of eyeshadows for each eye look. When starting
out, eyeliner and mascara are areas that you can easily pair back on to keep your kit minimal in the
beginning.
 Eyeshadow - When it comes to eyeshadow, you will first want to focus on having key neutral
tones in a matte or satin finish. These will be your most commonly used eyeshadows, so you
will want to first invest in these options. After you’ve built up your neutral colours, you can
then venture into more of the bold colours to supplement your kit. Many companies offer
eyeshadow palettes, which can give you a large variety of eyeshadow options in an easily
portable format. Especially when starting out, it’s important to remember that you don’t
need every colour and finish out on the market.
 Eyeliner - Here is an area that you can scale back on, since this may come down to personal
application preference. For eyeliner, you will definitely want to have a black and brown
pencil eyeliner as your basic for waterlines and more smoky lash lines. You will also want to
have a black and brown option in either a gel, liquid or felt tip liner. These will be your most
commonly used products, so this will be a great place to start your kit.
64 | P age
 Mascara - For mascara, you will primarily use disposable applicators to apply mascara to
your client’s lashes. Because of this, you really only need two versions of mascara - a regular
formula and a waterproof formula. Most clients will want black mascara, so this will likely be
the only colour you would need when starting out.
5.3.1.3 Kit Essentials – Lip, Cheek & Eyebrow Products
For lips, cheeks and eyebrows, there are a few key products that can help you round out the makeup in
your bridal and special occasion makeup kit. Using your knowledge about the different product options,
finishes and colour palettes, you can make strategic choices about which products you keep in your bridal
and special occasion makeup kit.
 Lips - When it comes to lip products, there are countless options for formulas, finishes,
colours and more. The product most commonly used will likely be lipstick, so it will be
helpful to pick up a few neutral colours and a few bold colours that could be used on a
variety of clients. For lip liner, if you have some neutral colours in your kit you can use these
for a number of lipstick colours as a “your lips but better” colour. Lastly, if you’re looking for
a gloss that will work for a number of lipsticks you can pick up a clear gloss to add shine to
the lips.
 Cheeks - For an easy way to carry a number of flattering blushes, picking up a blush palette
can be extremely helpful for your kit. If you pick up individual shadows, find ones that you
expect to be flattering on a number of skin tones and makeup looks. Similarly, there are a
number of high quality contour kits that have both bronzer and highlighter for an array of
skin tones. You will be most likely to use matte bronzers for contouring, so having a few
shades of matte bronzers will be helpful to use for both warming the face and creating
definition.
65 | P age
 Eyebrows - Brow products can range for each individual, so you may need to carry both
pencil and shadow brow products. By choosing a few strategic matte eyeshadows you can
use them for both brows and eyeshadow. Additionally, having a few brow pencils can allow
you to create a custom colour for any eyebrows. Lastly, having a clear brow gel to set the
eyebrows will be helpful for any client.
5.3.2 Tool Essentials
Now that you’ve put together the makeup in your kit, there are still a number of tools that will be
essential for maintaining sanitation and ease of application. Many tools assist with applying the makeup,
and allow you to complete the entire makeup look easily. Similarly, there are many tools that allow you
to maintain sanitation and easily work on a number of clients using the same makeup products.
 Disposable Applicators - Of all the essential tools, disposable applicators will be the most
helpful for you as you work on clients. Specifically, for mascara and lip products, disposable
applicators are essential to ensure that your makeup products in your kit do not get
contaminated.
 Palette - A sanitized palette is an extremely helpful tool to help apply many liquid and gel
products onto your client. Liquid products should not be applied onto the back of the hand
or even directly onto the brush when working on other people, as it is less sanitary and can
spread germs within your makeup palettes. Additionally, palettes are excellent for mixing
products to create a custom formula or shade for your client.
 Brush Cleaner - Especially when applying makeup on a large wedding party or group, brush
cleaner will be extremely helpful in quickly cleaning brushes between uses. Whether you’re
66 | P age
using the same brush in multiple colours or on different clients, it will be helpful to quickly
clean your makeup brushes to allow them to be used more frequently.
 Rubbing Alcohol - Rubbing alcohol is excellent for killing germs and sanitizing items. It is
important to have rubbing alcohol readily available in your kit, as it is the best way to
sanitize lipstick, tools, etc. Additionally, rubbing alcohol is a great way to clean your space to
keep things clean and germ-free.
 Brush Roll - To help keep your brushes organized and easily accessible, a brush roll will be a
helpful tool. In addition to holding brushes, a brush roll can also be a great space to hold
other tools like your palette, tissues, etc. Brush rolls will keep your tools at your fingertips,
and make applying makeup on your bride or client much easier.
5.4 Managing Event Day
Alright, it’s the day of the big event! Now is the time to put your learnings to action, and apply some
beautiful makeup looks on your bride or client. There will likely be a lot of things going on during the
event, so there are a few tips you can use to manage the event like a professional. It’s critical to make the
day go as smoothly as possible for both yourself and your client. Here are top tips to manage event day.
6. Consult with Your Client - On the day of the event, take a moment to check in with the
bride, client or any coordinator in charge of running the day. Consult with them on how the
day has gone thus far, timing for the makeup application, any last minute changes or other
information that may be helpful with you. You may want to inquire on the order for makeup
application for larger group bridal parties or events, where they would like you to set up
your station, and other important questions to keep the rest of the day going smoothly.
67 | P age
7. Serve as The Expert - Since this is an important day for your bride or client, they will likely
turn to you as the expert when it comes to their makeup. Feel confident in your knowledge,
and make the best decision for you and your client. If a bride is asking to switch to a bold lip
at the last minute, take a moment and assess the situation. Is this the best decision for her?
Is she feeling the adrenaline and emotion of the day, rather than thinking rationally about
how this will look long term? Serve as the expert and gently guide your client to the best
decisions for their big day.
8. Be Professional - Wedding or event day will likely be chaotic, so it is critical to stay
professional and gracious during times of stress. If a client isn’t happy with the makeup, or
things are running behind schedule, take those moments in stride and do your best to
correct them as quickly as possible. Be gracious, and don’t allow the stress of the event to
get to you. Remember, referrals will be critical so you want to give the best impression as
possible.
