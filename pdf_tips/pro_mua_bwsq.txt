UNIT 1.2: Make-up Services
Unit Objectives
At the end of this unit, participant will be able to:
1. Practise client consultation
2. Demonstrate the method of trolley setting
1.2.1 Client Consultation and Trolley setting
Client Consultation:
Before any treatment service, client consultation part is the most significant stage. During this stage,
the make-up artist observes and identifies the basic features of the client’s skin and individual needs.
This might take several minutes to complete. Let us now discuss some fundamentals during this stage:
• Give a consultation chart to the client and ask him/her to fill up the details. One may also ask
the client about his/her usual skin and features for the consultation chart.
• Ask the client for which occasion the make-up is required
• Ask the present skin care regimen.
• Ask if they are under any particular medication or had any treatment before.
Fig. 1.2.1: An on-going make-up service
Trolley Setting:
Setting up the work station is a crucial stage as you as a make-up artist would need all the necessary
items to be kept in an orderly way near you. Make sure that you have an adequate amount of
products with you. This will help you to have smooth communication with clients, along with
maintaining a sanitary environment. Most common items are:
• Facial tissues (non-scented)
• Cotton
• Headbands

Participant Handbook Bridal Fashion and Photographic Make-up Artist
• Vinyl gloves
• Sanitiser
• Service towel
• Small bowls
• Bottled water
• Cape for client
1.2.2 Makeup Consultation Chart
As a professional in the beauty industry, you may need to attend consultation meetings, especially for big
events. Even if you are confident with your make-up skills, you will have to consult your client and know
his/her specifications, skin care regimen and other details. You can prepare a make-up consultation
form to give out to clients and ask them to fill all the necessary details so that you can suggest a suitable
solution or make-up tips. A sample of a Makeup Consultation Chart is given below:

1.2.3 Hygiene Practice
Just before you start
Enquire if it is all right to remove the jewellery and if she agrees to it, place it in a safe box. The clients
can keep their jewellery in their handbags.
Cleaning your hand
You must wash your hands thoroughly before the treatment. You might also tell the clients about the
cleaning rituals you have followed in order to make them comfortable. However, before the beginning
of the treatment, your hands must be dry.
1.2.4 Skin and Hair Analysis Procedure
Skin Analysis
• The skin must be analysed before selecting the treatment
• Age and general health of the client must be taken into consideration
• Records of the progress of previous treatments must be taken
• The skin must be cleaned and analysed under a magnifying lamp
Procedure for Skin Analysis
• The skin must be cleaned following the steps of professional cleansing
• Eye pads must be placed after removing the cleanser
• The skin of the entire face and neck must be studied under the magnifying lamp
• Skin must be slightly stretched using the middle and index finger to reveal the skin texture, size of
pores, lines and flakiness
Hair Analysis
Analysing hair is a significant element during client consultation for determining the scalp and hair
condition. Ensure that you have explained the process before you start the process. For analysing the
hair, you will have to do the following tests on the client’s hair.
Elasticity Test
This is to test the internal strength of the hair (the cortex). Hair that has been damaged due to chemical
treatments may have lost much of its natural strength. This type of hair may stretch over two-thirds
of its original length and may even break off. It is important to carry out this test before perming. Well
conditioned hair will stretch and then return to its original length. Take one strand of hair and hold each
end firmly between the thumb and forefinger of each hand and gently pull. If the hair stretches more
than half of its original length, then it is over elastic and may snap or break during chemical processing.
Fig.1.2.3: On-going Elasticity Test

Participant Handbook Bridal Fashion and Photographic Make-up Artist
Porosity Test:
This tests the condition of the outer layer of the hair shaft – the cuticle. If the cuticle is damaged, it
becomes porous. Perming chemicals added to porous hair will be absorbed unevenly and may produce
uneven curl results. This is why special perm lotions for tinted and highlighted hair are used. They are
weaker in strength and are less likely to over process the hair and give a poor result. Take a strand of
hair and hold it by the points (where the hair has been cut) between the thumb and forefinger of one
hand. Run the forefinger and thumb of your other hand from the root (where the hair grows from)
down to the point. If the hair feels rough and bumpy, the cuticle scales are raised and open, and this is
an indication of porous hair. If the hair feels smooth, the cuticle is flat and closed, and the hair’s cuticle
region is in good condition.
Fig. 1.2.4: On-going Porosity Test
1.2.5 Preparation of Skin in CTM procedure
Before starting any treatment, CTM (Cleansing, Toning, and Moisturizing) procedure is very much
significant. CTM procedure cleans the skin, clears pores and moisturises the skin for further treatment
or makeup.
Cleansing: For this stage, you will first need to remove the remaining makeup on the skin. Baby oil or
any vegetable oil can be very helpful for this process. Other than that, you can also use cleansing milk
or any popular cleanser available in the market as per the skin condition of your client.
Toning: This process was not much popular even some years back; however using toners help the skin
in the long run. Toners add hydration to the skin and make it suppler. Try to use toners without alcohol
content. Take some amount of toner in a cotton ball adding a little water to it. This will help to double-
cleanse the skin and clear the pores. You can also spray it on the face directly and pat it on the client’s face.
Moisturising: This is the last stage of cleansing, which prevents the loss of moisture from the skin by
adding another layer to the skin. Make sure you are well aware of the type of your client’s skin before
applying the moisturiser.
1.2.6 Care of Hands and Feet
Makeup artists need to give special attention to clients so that any bad odour, infection or injury of the
feet and hands can be prevented. Problems may arise from different issues such as poor care of abuse
of feet and hands, such as wearing bad fitting issues, biting nails, etc. In order to take care of the feet
and hands, you need to examine the skin surface.

Participant Handbook Bridal Fashion and Portfolio Make-up Artist
1.2.7 Safety Precautions
A professional makeup artist plays a very important role in maintaining the health and safety guidelines.
It is important to be alert and careful about spreading infection. Along with denting the image of the
salon, it risks the health and safety of the people trusting the parlour and its employees.
Hygiene maintenance is extremely important in salons. High standards of hygiene maintenance are
necessary for controlling diseases and infections. Be careful about the following:
Hands should be washed properly and regularly to avoid risks. The salon has many opportunities for
contacting germs and cross infection, such as, shaking hands with friends and client’s, working on the
client’s skin, etc.
• Ensure that the work area is clean.
• Hands should be properly washed after each session with soap and water.
• After washing hands, sanitisers should be used.
Chair and Couches in a Salon
Clean chair and sofas in the salon regularly. Regular cleaning reduces the risk of infection significantly.
Chair and couches made from PVC (Poly Vinyl Chloride) or vinyl are easy to clean. When cleaning such
chairs avoid disinfectants which have alcohol (ethanol) as this can react with the PVC/vinyl, make it
brittle, leading to cracks. It is very difficult to disinfect a cracked surface, and it can become prone to
germs.
Tools and Instruments
• Sanitise all tools well before every client and in between client’s treatment.
• Use a good quality disinfectant to protect the tools and instruments.
• Make sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Your disinfectant solution must have rust
inhibitors to protect metal equipment.
• Tools such as nail files should not be immersed in a disinfectant solution.
• If using the nail file for two clients, make sure that it is adequately sanitised. Follow a simple rule, if
the nail file has come in contact with any body fluids, and then use a fresh one for the next client.
1.2.8 Make-Up Artist as a Career
Working as a professional makeup artist may be an offbeat career choice, but it has great potential in
contemporary times. If you have a passion for working full time, you can earn your livelihood.
