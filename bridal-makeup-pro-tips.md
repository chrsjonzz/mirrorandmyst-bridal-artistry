# Pro Bridal Makeup Tips

## 1. Prepping Your Skin for the Big Day
- Start a gentle skincare routine 2-3 months before the wedding.
- Hydrate your skin daily and exfoliate 1-2 times a week.
- Use a hydrating sheet mask the night before for a radiant glow.
- Avoid trying new products right before the wedding to prevent reactions.

## 2. Foundation & Base: Flawless and Long-Lasting
- Use a silicone-based primer for smoothness and longevity (e.g., Smashbox Photo Finish).
- Choose a long-wear, photo-friendly foundation (MAC Studio Fix Fluid, Estée Lauder Double Wear).
- Apply foundation in thin layers and blend well for a natural finish.
- Use a lightweight, brightening concealer for under eyes and blemishes.

## 3. Eyes: Waterproof, Photo-Ready Looks
- Prime eyelids to prevent creasing (use MAC Paint Pot or Urban Decay Primer Potion).
- Choose waterproof mascara and eyeliner (Huda Beauty Legit Lashes).
- Use individual lashes for a soft, fluttery effect.
- Opt for neutral or soft shimmer tones for timeless photos.

## 4. Lips: Kiss-Proof, Bold or Natural
- Exfoliate lips and apply a hydrating balm before lipstick.
- Use a lip liner to define and prevent feathering.
- Choose a long-wear lipstick (MAC Ruby Woo, Huda Beauty Liquid Matte).
- Blot and layer for extra staying power.

## 5. Setting & Longevity: All-Day Perfection
